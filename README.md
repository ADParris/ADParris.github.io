Built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com), the original design is by [Brittany Chiang](https://brittanychiang.com). I found it one of the prettiest out of the few hundred that I looked at for inspiration. So, I set out to re-engineer what she'd built. The animation package is [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion). I had a lot of fun making the animations work with it! In any event, this was a fun project that I'm now using for my portfolio.
