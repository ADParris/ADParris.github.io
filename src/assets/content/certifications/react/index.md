I've taken several courses on React to be sure that I wasn't missing anything. The best one that I have found was [Modern React with Redux](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux) by Stephen Grider on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com). Stephen goes in-depth on all aspects of React, React Router, Redux, and more. It's a fantastic resource!
