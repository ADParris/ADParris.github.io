The original design of this site is by Brittany Chiang(a link to her website is in the footer of this site). I found the design to be the most beautiful of the ones I had viewed, and it is a Gatsby site. That gave me a perfect opportunity to learn some Gatsby-specific workings from her, such as setting up path aliases for my code. So I got to work implementing her design into this site using the tools I am familiar with, such as Chakra-UI. I had a lot of fun creating this site and am currently using it as my portfolio.
