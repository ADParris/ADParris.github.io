This one is special to me as I made it for my wife, Molly. It is her spot on the web. Created using [React](https://reactjs.org), this site incorporates both user authentication and a database from [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com). The site also utilizes [Redux](https://redux.js.org) for its state, [React Router](https://reactrouter.com) for in-app routing, and quite a bit of custom javascript to handle the Post, Comment, and Reply systems. The site closely mimics [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com)'s layout, including themes for light/dark modes.
