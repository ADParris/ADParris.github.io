I found the design to be the most beautiful of the ones I had viewed, and it is a Gatsby site. That gave me a perfect opportunity to learn some Gatsby-specific workings from her, such as setting up path aliases for my code. So I got to work implementing her design into this site using the tools I am familiar with, such as Chakra-UI. I had a lot of fun creating this site and am currently using it as my portfolio.\r\n"}]},"id":1,"imageDark":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#080828","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/5f2970620d8819e7c4001744d10cd96a/96b96/adparris-dark.png","srcSet":"/static/5f2970620d8819e7c4001744d10cd96a/77a8a/adparris-dark.png 750w,\n/static/5f2970620d8819e7c4001744d10cd96a/b8282/adparris-dark.png 1080w,\n/static/5f2970620d8819e7c4001744d10cd96a/84c5b/adparris-dark.png 1366w,\n/static/5f2970620d8819e7c4001744d10cd96a/96b96/adparris-dark.png 1919w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/5f2970620d8819e7c4001744d10cd96a/3dc2f/adparris-dark.webp 750w,\n/static/5f2970620d8819e7c4001744d10cd96a/5642c/adparris-dark.webp 1080w,\n/static/5f2970620d8819e7c4001744d10cd96a/c3ac2/adparris-dark.webp 1366w,\n/static/5f2970620d8819e7c4001744d10cd96a/6cc2a/adparris-dark.webp 1919w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.47472642001042215}}},"imageLight":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"fullWidth","backgroundColor":"#e8e8e8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/62ffc5eca806040fab9dbf5d6edb5879/33c84/adparris-light.png","srcSet":"/static/62ffc5eca806040fab9dbf5d6edb5879/77a8a/adparris-light.png 750w,\n/static/62ffc5eca806040fab9dbf5d6edb5879/4842f/adparris-light.png 1080w,\n/static/62ffc5eca806040fab9dbf5d6edb5879/84c5b/adparris-light.png 1366w,\n/static/62ffc5eca806040fab9dbf5d6edb5879/33c84/adparris-light.png 1919w","sizes":"100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/62ffc5eca806040fab9dbf5d6edb5879/3dc2f/adparris-light.webp 750w,\n/static/62ffc5eca806040fab9dbf5d6edb5879/c2369/adparris-light.webp 1080w,\n/static/62ffc5eca806040fab9dbf5d6edb5879/c3ac2/adparris-light.webp 1366w,\n/static/62ffc5eca806040fab9dbf5d6edb5879/359fa/adparris-light.webp 1919w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"100vw"}]},"width":1,"height":0.47420531526836895}}},"link":"https://adparris.com","repo":"https://github.com/ADParris/portfolio","title":"ADParris"},"details":"<p>Created using <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Gatsby</a>, this static site has implemented features such as light/dark modes and animations with reduced motion (if you have that option enabled in your OS).</p>"},{"frontmatter":{"additional":{"info":[{"note":"By design, there is no sign-up system on this site.
